# Deep-Audio-Classification

This repository contains code for an audio classification project using TensorFlow. The goal of the project is to classify audio clips into two categories: Capuchin bird calls and non-Capuchin bird calls. The code processes audio clips, converts them into spectrograms, and uses a deep learning model to make predictions.
